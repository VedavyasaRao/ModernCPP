# Modern C++ #
*Discusses some of the regular and C++ 11 and 14 features*
## New anguage Features ##
The following discusses some of the new features introduced in C++11 and 14.
### auto
The auto keyword is remnant of C that was used to declare local variable in a function. In C++ it has a different meaning and is used to assign a data type based on initialized value.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#auto).
### decltype
decltype is reverse of auto where a data type can be deduced from a variable or an expression. decltype can also be used specify return types in template functions.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#decltype).
### declval
It's a template function for type T.It returns an rvalue reference to type T without referring to any object, making it possible to use member functions in the operand of the decltype specifier without the need to go through constructors. T may be an incomplete type.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#declval).
### long long
The size of long is not consistent across platforms. In linux,  it's 64 bits and in Windows it's 32 bits.The new data type long long is a 64 bits across all the platforms.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/numerical-library.html#long_long).
### nullptr_t
nullptr_t data type is introduced specifically to prevent misuse of NULL in place of null pointers. nullptr is the only instance of this type and can be used in place of a null pointer.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/smartpointers.html#nullptr).
### char16_t and char32_t
char16_t  and char32_t  were introduced to provide uniformity among other things. The size of char16_t data type is fixed at 16 bits and the size of char32_t data type is fixed at 32 bits across all the platforms. char16_t is used for UTF-16 encoding and   char32_t is used for UTF-32 encoding.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#char16_t).
### constexpr
The keyword constexpr means constant expression. Like const, it can be applied to variable. Also, unlike const, constexpr can also be applied to functions and class constructors. constexpr indicates variable value, or return value, which is constant and, where possible, is computed at compile time.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/constexpr.html).
### =default
=default
In  C++ 11, a class can define following special member functions.
- default constructor
- copy constructor
- copy assignment operator
- destructor
- move constructor
- move assignment operator 
If it's missing, the compiler conditionally generates some of these functions.
Sometimes it's desirable to explicitly generate these functions, when it's not generated by the compiler  using keyword =default. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/05/defaut-and-delete.html#=default).
### =delete
It's also possible to suppress conditional generation of these functions by using keyword =delete.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/05/defaut-and-delete.html#=delete).
### initializer_list
The C++11 standard library introduced a new template based type initializer_list <T> to handle variable-length {}-lists. initializer_list is used to aid uniform initialization. It's automatically created when braces {} are used to initialize.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/list-initialization.html#initializer_list).
### list initialization
list initialization enables uniform way of initializing arithmetic types such as int, double etc or structs, classes using a pair of braces {}.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/list-initialization.html#list_initialization).
### rvalue reference
When using containers such as lists, vectors, maps, a lot of temporary objects are created and destroyed during the life time of an application. 
To overcome this, rvalue reference and move semantics are introduced.  An rvalue reference behaves just like an lvalue reference except that it can bind to a temporary value.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#rvalue).
### move
move semantics takes advantage of  the new rvalue reference to optimize temporary object creation and its reuse.   
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#move).
### perfect forwarding
The rvalue semantics enable passing the arguments without ambiguity  to the handler function in the factory method.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#Perfect).
### Universal reference
Before C++11, universal reference was used to bind to both rvalue and lvalue. An universal reference is formed by making const reference of some type as shown below.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#universal).
### namespace
In large projects, multiple classes can share same name, which can lead to compilation errors and confusion. namespace can be used to modularise them in separately to avoid overlapping. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/07/namespaces-and-using.html#namespace).
### using
typedefs are commonly used provide an alias to a type. However it has some limitations when used in templates. In C++ 11, using keyword is introduced to overcome these limitations also extend its functionality.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/07/namespaces-and-using.html#using).
### noexcept
noexcept specifier determines whether a function could throw exceptions.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#noexcept).
### override
n a multi class hierarchy, virtual functions enable overriding base class functionality by derived classes. However sometimes it can be confusing and often mistakes can happen in a large project if the signatures don't match in the derived classes. The suffix override is designed to overcome this. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#override).
### final
Sometimes it's desirable to prevent overriding a virtual function or derivation from a class itself. The suffix final is designed to handle it.
final keyword indicates compiler that a virtual function of a base class cannot be overridden. in derived classes. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#final).
### range for loop
*for* loops are versatile can be used in various scenarios. *range based for* loop are designed to work with containers so that their elements for a given range can be iterated directly either by value or a by reference.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#range).
### static_assert
Macros such as assert() can be used in debug builds to check for errors during runtime to break when an error condition becomes true.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#static_assert).
### variadic template
With the variadic templates feature, it's possible to define template based class or function that can have any number (including zero) of parameters. 
To accomplish this, a new kind of parameter called parameter pack is introduced that can singly represent a list of zero or more parameters in the templates definition. A template class or function with at least one parameter pack is called a variadic template.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/variadic-templates.html).
## type traits ##
type_traits were introduced in C++11, basically defines templates for compile-time constants that give information about the properties of their type arguments, or produce transformed types. The classes and templates in type_traits are used to support type inference, classification, and transformation at compile time.
### Utility classes
type traits classes internally uses a number of utility classes  such as integral_constant in its implementation. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Utility).
### Unary type traits
Unary Type Traits describe a property of a single type. Most Unary Type Traits return true or false and are derived from true_type or false_type. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Unary).
### Binary Type Traits
Binary Type Traits provide information about a relationship between two types. Every Binary Type Trait return  true_type  or false_type. based on the presence or absence of a specific relationship between the two argument types.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Binary).
### Transformation Type Traits
Transformation Type Traits modify a type. Every Transformation Type Trait possesses a nested typedef named type that represents the result of the modification. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Transformation).

More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#Unicode).
### raw string
Assigning a free flowing text to a string variable has been a challenge especially if it contains " character embedded in it.The raw string feature enables declaring strings containing special characters such as newline, tab etc as is without escaping.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#raw).
### user defined literals
In  C++, arithmetic types such as long, float can be represented with suffix as 1L,1.2f etc. C++11 extends this to represent standard library and user defined types using user defined literals.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#user).

The derived classes overrides *what()* to return error string. In addition, newer classes such as *error_code* and *error_condition*  were added to return additional error information.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/exception.html).
### function
A function class can wrap any kind of callable element (such as functions and function objects) into a copyable object, and whose type depends solely on its call signature (and not on the callable element type itself).  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/lambda.html).
### io stream
The IOStreams provides classes to perform IO for console, disk and memory as an alternative to CRT functions. In C++11, new classes were introduced to handle currency and time.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/iostream-classes-quick-tour-with.html).
### localization
Each country has one or more native speaking languages and writing systems or a scripts, numbering symbols, number grouping symbol, decimal point symbol, currency symbols, date format etc. 
The *locale* and *facet* classes provide the support for all these aspects so that it can be integrated into the daily lives of the people, government and businesses etc.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/internationalization-quick-tour-with.html).
### mem_fn
This function converts member function to a functor whose functional call invokes the member function pointed by pm.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/lambda.html).
### numeric limits
numeric_limits is a template class that defines functions such as min(), max() along with host of other functions that are related to arithmetic types. Specialized classes from numeric_limits are defined for fundamental arithmetic types such as int, double. These methods in these classes can be used instead of  of macros such as INT_MAX.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/10/numeric-limits.html).
### predefined function objects
Predefined function objects are defined in the std. library to perform bitwise, relational, logical and arithmetic operations.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/lambda.html).
### ratio library
standard library defines a new template class *ratio* to define ratios that can be used only during compile time.*ratio* is used in chrono library to represent different time units such as millisecond, hour etc.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/10/ratio.html).
### reference_wrapper
reference_wrapper is a class template that creates a wrapper around a reference to object or reference to function of type T. Instances of reference_wrapper are objects but they are implicitly convertible to T&, so that they can be used as arguments with the functions that take the underlying type by reference.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/lambda.html).
### ref and cref
Function templates ref and cref are helper functions that generate an object of type reference_wrapper, using template argument deduction to determine the template argument of the result.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/lambda.html).
### smart pointer
CRT does not have garbage collector support therefore  dangling pointers, leaked resources causes instability in applications. Smartpointers are  used to get around this issue. A Smartpointer is basically a RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) object that wraps a pointer to an object or an array. New classes such as *unique_ptr* for sole ownership, *shared_ptr* for shared ownership and *weak_ptr* for non ownership references.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/smartpointer.html).
### type traits
type_traits were introduced in C++11, basically defines templates for compile-time constants that give information about the properties of their type arguments, or produce transformed types. The classes and templates in type_traits are used to support type inference, classification, and transformation at compile time.
