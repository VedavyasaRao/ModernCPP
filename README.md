# Modern C++ #
*Discusses some of the regular and C++ 11 and 14 features*
## New Language Features ##
The following discusses some of the new features introduced in C++11 and 14.
### auto
The auto keyword is remnant of C that was used to declare local variable in a function. In C++ it has a different meaning and is used to assign a data type based on initialized value.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#auto).
### decltype
decltype is reverse of auto where a data type can be deduced from a variable or an expression. decltype can also be used specify return types in template functions.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#decltype).
### declval
It's a template function for type T.It returns an rvalue reference to type T without referring to any object, making it possible to use member functions in the operand of the decltype specifier without the need to go through constructors. T may be an incomplete type.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#declval).
### long long
The size of long is not consistent across platforms. In linux,  it's 64 bits and in Windows it's 32 bits.The new data type long long is a 64 bits across all the platforms.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/numerical-library.html#long_long).
### nullptr_t
nullptr_t data type is introduced specifically to prevent misuse of NULL in place of null pointers. nullptr is the only instance of this type and can be used in place of a null pointer.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/smartpointers.html#nullptr).
### char16_t and char32_t
char16_t  and char32_t  were introduced to provide uniformity among other things. The size of char16_t data type is fixed at 16 bits and the size of char32_t data type is fixed at 32 bits across all the platforms. char16_t is used for UTF-16 encoding and   char32_t is used for UTF-32 encoding.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#char16_t).
### constexpr
The keyword constexpr means constant expression. Like const, it can be applied to variable. Also, unlike const, constexpr can also be applied to functions and class constructors. constexpr indicates variable value, or return value, which is constant and, where possible, is computed at compile time.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/constexpr.html).
### =default
=default
In  C++ 11, a class can define following special member functions.
- default constructor
- copy constructor
- copy assignment operator
- destructor
- move constructor
- move assignment operator 
If it's missing, the compiler conditionally generates some of these functions.
Sometimes it's desirable to explicitly generate these functions, when it's not generated by the compiler  using keyword =default. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/05/defaut-and-delete.html#=default).
### =delete
It's also possible to suppress conditional generation of these functions by using keyword =delete.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/05/defaut-and-delete.html#=delete).
### initializer_list
The C++11 standard library introduced a new template based type initializer_list <T> to handle variable-length {}-lists. initializer_list is used to aid uniform initialization. It's automatically created when braces {} are used to initialize.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/list-initialization.html#initializer_list).
### list initialization
list initialization enables uniform way of initializing arithmetic types such as int, double etc or structs, classes using a pair of braces {}.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/list-initialization.html#list_initialization).
### rvalue reference
When using containers such as lists, vectors, maps, a lot of temporary objects are created and destroyed during the life time of an application. 
To overcome this, rvalue reference and move semantics are introduced.  An rvalue reference behaves just like an lvalue reference except that it can bind to a temporary value.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#rvalue).
### move
move semantics takes advantage of  the new rvalue reference to optimize temporary object creation and its reuse.   
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#move).
### perfect forwarding
The rvalue semantics enable passing the arguments without ambiguity  to the handler function in the factory method.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#Perfect).
### Universal reference
Before C++11, universal reference was used to bind to both rvalue and lvalue. An universal reference is formed by making const reference of some type as shown below.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/move-semantics.html#universal).
### namespace
In large projects, multiple classes can share same name, which can lead to compilation errors and confusion. namespace can be used to modularise them in separately to avoid overlapping. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/07/namespaces-and-using.html#namespace).
### using
typedefs are commonly used provide an alias to a type. However it has some limitations when used in templates. In C++ 11, using keyword is introduced to overcome these limitations also extend its functionality.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/07/namespaces-and-using.html#using).
### noexcept
noexcept specifier determines whether a function could throw exceptions.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#noexcept).
### override
n a multi class hierarchy, virtual functions enable overriding base class functionality by derived classes. However sometimes it can be confusing and often mistakes can happen in a large project if the signatures don't match in the derived classes. The suffix override is designed to overcome this. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#override).
### final
Sometimes it's desirable to prevent overriding a virtual function or derivation from a class itself. The suffix final is designed to handle it.
final keyword indicates compiler that a virtual function of a base class cannot be overridden. in derived classes. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#final).
### range for loop
*for* loops are versatile can be used in various scenarios. *range based for* loop are designed to work with containers so that their elements for a given range can be iterated directly either by value or a by reference.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#range).
### static_assert
Macros such as assert() can be used in debug builds to check for errors during runtime to break when an error condition becomes true.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/new-language-support.html#static_assert).
### variadic template
With the variadic templates feature, it's possible to define template based class or function that can have any number (including zero) of parameters. 
To accomplish this, a new kind of parameter called parameter pack is introduced that can singly represent a list of zero or more parameters in the templates definition. A template class or function with at least one parameter pack is called a variadic template.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/09/variadic-templates.html).
## type traits ##
type_traits were introduced in C++11, basically defines templates for compile-time constants that give information about the properties of their type arguments, or produce transformed types. The classes and templates in type_traits are used to support type inference, classification, and transformation at compile time.
### Utility classes
type traits classes internally uses a number of utility classes  such as integral_constant in its implementation. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Utility).
### Unary type traits
Unary Type Traits describe a property of a single type. Most Unary Type Traits return true or false and are derived from true_type or false_type. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Unary).
### Binary Type Traits
Binary Type Traits provide information about a relationship between two types. Every Binary Type Trait return  true_type  or false_type. based on the presence or absence of a specific relationship between the two argument types.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Binary).
### Transformation Type Traits
Transformation Type Traits modify a type. Every Transformation Type Trait possesses a nested typedef named type that represents the result of the modification. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Transformation).
### Memory Allocation
Allocate uninitialized memory of POD type.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/type-traits.html#Memory).
## Literals and Strings ##
strings and literals are essential part of any programming language. The following describes various facilities and classes available to handle strings and literals.
### char_traits
char_traits classes define common behavior such as comparison, assignment, copy etc. and also other aspects such as eof  type, offset type position type etc.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2024/11/chartraits.html).
### char16_t and char32_t
char16_t  and char32_t  were introduced to provide uniformity among other things. The size of char16_t data type is fixed at 16 bits and the size of char32_t data type is fixed at 32 bits across all the platforms. char16_t is used for UTF-16 encoding and   char32_t is used for UTF-32 encoding.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#char16_t).
### Unicode String Literals
string literals prefixed with u8 are encoded as UTF-8. Similarly, prefix for UTF-32 encoded strings is U. char_32_t is used for encoding UTF-32 strings. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#Unicode).
### raw string
Assigning a free flowing text to a string variable has been a challenge especially if it contains " character embedded in it.The raw string feature enables declaring strings containing special characters such as newline, tab etc as is without escaping.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#raw).
### user defined literals
In  C++, arithmetic types such as long, float can be represented with suffix as 1L,1.2f etc. C++11 extends this to represent standard library and user defined types using user defined literals.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/strings-and-literals.html#user).
### basic_string
CRT provides plethora of functions to handle strings. There are different functions for getting length, append, copy, find etc. 
std::basic_string class attempts to objectify strings so that it's easier to use.  
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/string.html).
## regular expressions ##
Regular expressions are indispensable when looking for a specific information.
They are highly versatile to filter out information or for validating inputs without needing to write lots of code.  
### Validation
Regular expressions can be used to validate an input.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Validation).
### Extraction
Regular expressions can be used to extract information from the input strings.   
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Extraction).
### Dot character
Patterns can use . to map any character except some control characters. Note that it has no effect in a character class construct and maps to decimal point.   
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Dot).
### Character class
The basic ingredient of the regular expression grammar is a character class. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Character).
### Shorthands
To reduce clutter, shorthands to character classes are provided. These can be freely used in another character class or even in pattern.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Predefined).
### Escaping
Some times a meta character needs to be escaped in a pattern or a character class. Escaping is done by placing \  in front of the meta character. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Escaping).
### Anchors and boundary markers
Anchors and  boundary markers marks special locations such as beginning or ending of the lines, word boundaries etc. These can be used only in the pattern and not in character classes.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Anchors).
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine  repetitiveness of a token in the pattern. Quantifiers applies to any token in the pattern only. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Quantifiers).
### Greedy, Lazy and Possessive Quantifiers
Produces different results for the same patteren with different Quantifiers.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Greedy).
### Capture groups
The capture groups are one of the key aspects of the regular expression.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Capture).
### Non capturing groups
Non capturing groups are used for efficiency and optimization. As the name indicates, contents of non capturing groups are discarded.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Capture2).
### References
aptured groups in a pattern are internally labeled as \1, \2 , \3 etc.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#References).
### Unicode support
The behavior of the regular expression engine can be changed by setting flags in the pattern.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Unicode).
### Branch Reset Groups
Consider a pattern (1a)|(2a)|(1b)\1. This defines three capture groups. For the input 1a1a, it is expected to match, however it does not.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Branch).
### LookAround
There are 4 types look around, positive/negative look ahead/behind. Collectively they are called lookaround, are zero-length assertions just like the start and end of line, or start and end of word anchors. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#LookAround).
### LookBehind with \K
Due to certain restriction in matching expression of positive lookbehind i.e., <=expression,  as an alternative to positive lookbehind, \K switch can be used. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#LookBehind).
### Atomic Grouping
An atomic group is a group that, when the regex engine exits from it, automatically throws away all backtracking positions remembered by any tokens inside the group. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Atomic).
### If-Then-Else Conditionals
If-Then-Else is a special construct allows creation of conditional regular expressions.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#If).
### Recursion
Suppose the task is to find out if random number of open and close braces such as () or {} match, regular expression recursion comes to the rescue.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Recursion).
### Subroutines
Subroutines are applied to the capture groups. These are very similar to regular expression recursion. Instead of matching the entire regular expression again, a subroutine call only matches the regular expression inside a capturing group. A subroutine call can be made to any capturing group from anywhere in the pattern. A call made to same capturing group leads to recursion.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Subroutines).
### Using Regular expressions in C++
It's possible to replace  captured groups or entire match. Regular expressions is a part of in C++ 11 standard library,  however it does not support many features discussed here. An alternate would be to use boost libraries which seems compatible with feature rich  perl.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2023/11/regular-expression-quick-tour-with_6.html#Using).
## localization ##
Each country has one or more native speaking languages and writing systems or a scripts, numbering symbols, number grouping symbol, decimal point symbol, currency symbols, date format etc. 
The *locale* and *facet* classes provide the support for all these aspects so that it can be integrated into the daily lives of the people, government and businesses etc.  
### Character Set
A Character Set is a set of characters identifying a particular writing system of a particular region.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Character_Set).
### Encoding
Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to the characters of the character set, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers so that they can be reinterpreted back correctly. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2025/01/encoding.html).
### codepages
A code page is basically a coded character set. The term code page initially referred to the page number of IBM standard character set manual containing character mapping for plethora of character sets. 
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#codepages).
### Localization
Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software or applications to be accessible and adaptable to different languages, cultures, and regions. Localization is the process of adapting software or applications to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target market or locale. 
While internationalization creates a framework that supports multiple languages and regions, localization involves customizing the software or application for a specific target market or region.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Localization).
### Locales
A locale is a collection of information pertaining to a culture, region, and language. Locales are physically stored in external files in POSIX environments. In Windows, they are located in the registry.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Locales).
### Locales in C
In C, locales can be set using setlocale() api.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Locales_C).
### locale class
In C++, a locales are represented by a locale object, which  is a collection of indexed facets. It also contains a basic_regex object.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2025/01/locale.html).
### Facets
facets are defined for each category.  It's possible to override default behavior of a fact.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Facets).
### Character classification and conversion
CRT provides set of functions to classify characters and changes their cases to  upper or lower. Standard library also provides template based functions to provide the same facility.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/2025/02/character-classification-and-conversion.html).
### Unicode Conversion Facets
he following are Codecvt based facets to convert Unicode based formats with each other. For example, conversion from  UTF-8 to UCS-2, UTF-16 and UTF-32. Also reverse.
More details can be found [here➹](https://modcpp11.blogspot.com/p/localization.html#Unicode_Conversion).
### String and stream conversions
Performs conversions between wide strings and byte strings (on either direction) using a conversion object of type
